#### 1. Something should change as we click on some button or the UI need's to be rerendered as the result of the event of clicking tht button -----> This is nothing but the sign of creating a state or need ot state

#### 2. The components(custome components) we create don't support javascript event listeners like "onClick, onChange" in that case we need to use the "prop".
